# Point Two Five

**Point Two Five** is a (hopefully growing) set of user experience and interface sketching templates. All elements of the templates are crafted with ultra-fine 0.25pt lines to keep the emphasis on _your_ work, not mine. All elements are placed on letter-sized, 8.5-by-11 inch canvases for your convenience. See the screenshots below!

A PDF of the latest templates is in the root of this repository for easy access.

#### Setup

**Step 1** Clone the repo by running this command in Terminal:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:jvlahos/point-two-five.git
